# TMX2Moses
TMX2Moses transforms a translation memory file into two bitext files suitable for training a statistical machine translation system like Moses.
Thus TMX2Moses makes it possible to train your machine translation system on a corpus consisting of the documents you (or some one else) have translated. This is a great advantage as the vocabulary and style is adapted to the domain you are working on. The software has been tested mainly on TMX-files created with OmegaT, but it works with TMX-files created with other CAT-tools (Computer Aided Translation) as well.
